== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why is important that my wordpress template is SEO ready? =
If you have been installed this plugin, it is possible that you already know the answer. There are two big areas in the SEO world, the SEO Off page (link building, social media, domain authority...) and SEO On page (website faster, optimized, HTML5 ready, with rich snippets, etc). 

This plugin, tries to help you to optimize your SEO On page by telling you which things you could change in order to improve your ranking at SERP. Because you should never forget that if your website ranks better than other, more visits you will have and more money will you earn. (because all this is about the money, isn't it?)

= Can you explain me in more deep every SEO factor? =
Sure, all of them are detailed inside plugin's FAQ section.

= How you determine final score? =
Based on my experience of SEO manager I developed an algorithm who scraps your theme and check every factor defined in the plugin to know if your template is SEO friendly. Then, foreach factor your theme gets an score and the sum of all of them determines the current URL score.

= What should I do if my wordpress template had a lower score? = 
If you don't care about SEO, don't do anything. If you care about SEO and you don't mind about your design you can try another wordpress theme. If you really like your current theme, you can try to fix the errors manually. And if you don't have the knowledge to fix the errors manually you can try to hire me.

= Can I hire you to check and fix my wordpress site to be ready for SEO? =
Of course! You can contact me anytime writing me or following on Google+, Twitter, Linkedin, Facebook or in my personal site. Tell me about you and your site and let's see if we come to an agreement.
